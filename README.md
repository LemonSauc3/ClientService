## Client Server Logging System

This was a school project to do a bit of research on what makes a good logger and to implement it in a language that we have not used.

I did this assignment in Java as it was a language I had not used up until this point in the class.

## Usage

To use this project:
- simply run the client.java file to get started and follow the command line prompts

There is two options, 
- 1 to run an automated list of logs that run dummy function calls. 
- 2 is to run manual tasks for logging on the same dummy functions.
